![Final Render](./readme_images/AppMenu.png)

# Exercice 1: (html/css integration)
## Create this rendering
The goal is to create a gallery of images as followed: (on page gallery)
![Final Render](./readme_images/finalRender.png)

By any way you find appropriate

# Exercice 2: (API use)
## Get the list of the first generation pokemon

![PokeApi](./readme_images/pokeapi.png)

The goal is to fetch some pokemons data through an API: (on page pokedex listing)
- display the sprites of the 150 first pokemon (the real ones !!!)
- on click, display the card with some extra info on the pokemon

**You can use the libraries that you want. And feel free to think about any architecture, structure, or test that you would expect to see in a project**

For this exercise we will use the **PokeAPI** API endpoint which can be used either with GraphQL or REST:

Documentation:
https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon

Public API GraphQL:
https://beta.pokeapi.co/graphql/console/

Public API Rest:
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=20&offset=20

# Exercice 3: (Code review and improvement)
## Pokedex Code Quality

<img src="./readme_images/pokedex.png" width=120 />

On page Pokedex

A pokedex page is already coded, can you review it and identify any issues or areas for improvement. You can provide specific suggestions for how to fix or improve the code.

Write test cases for a given code snippet or function to ensure that it is working correctly and is robust against edge cases and unexpected input.

Explain the best practices or coding standards that should be followed when writing code, and how they can help improve the quality and maintainability of the codebase.

Overall, the goal of the code review exercise is to assess your abilities to write high-quality code, identify and fix issues, and follow best practices and coding standards.
